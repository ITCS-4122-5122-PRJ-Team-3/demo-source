    Welcome to project team 3â€™s final project. We are Zachary Onisick, Iryna Naminat,  Alec Goncharow, Rachel Conforti.

  <h3>Background:</h3>
  <p>
  The dataset we have chosen has data on over ten thousand customers on various categories such as age, salary, marital status, education levels, dependents, credit card limit, and income category. 
  We choose this dataset because there is a lot of information we pull from this dataset. For example, we can make inferences about how different groups of customers handle their money, potential contributing factors, 
  and just overall interesting information about credit card users. Our main goal with our project was to give the user the ability to pick and choose what they would like to compare as well as answer a try to answer a few of 
  our own questions.  
  </p>

  <h3>Who can use this information:</h3>
  <p>
  We believe this visualization could be used by many different people. It can be used by banks to figure out patterns within different groups of customers and show insightful information. 
  Our visualizations can be used to educate students, customers, or even staff on what can happen in credit scenarios. 
  And lastly, any user interested in credit trends and contributing factors can use these visualizations to answer questions.
